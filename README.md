It draws points -> lines -> triangles based on the code which you supply. The effectiveness of web GL is based on the code which is supplied to make use of the formention, points, lines and triangles. Web GL makes use of the GPU which is present on your computer, therefore the code needs to be executable from the computer itself, not serverside.
